# Golang Study

### Why Go?

- What was happening at Google...
- Created by Ken Thompson (Unix, B, C), Rob Pike (UTF-8), and Robert Griesemer.
- In 2006, there was no language that was fast to compile, fast to execute, and easy to program. It is a language created to solve performance and complexity issues.
- https://golang.org/doc/faq#creating_a_new_language
- Efficient
 - Standard library is available
 - Multiplataform.
 - Garbage collection (lightning fast!)
 - Cross-compile.
- Easy to use
 - It is a compiled language, with strong and static typing,
 - There are very few reserved words, which we will all learn in the course, in other words, they are very good to learn
 - only goes up in popularity lists
- Killer feature: In 2006, right after the first dual core. Thread: 1mb. Goroutine: 2kb.
- It's awesome!
- When to use Go?
 - Scale
 - Web services, networks, servers (machine learning, image processing, crypto, ...)
 - When you need a fast, simple, easy-to-learn, and easy-to-use language.
- Used in: APIs, CLIs, microservices, libraries/framework, data processing, ... It is the basis of cloud services and container orchestration.

### Hello world!

- := looks like a groundhog (gopher) or the punisher.
- Usage:
 - Automatic typing
 - Can only be repeated if there are new variables
 - != do assignment operator
 - Only works within codeblocks
- Terminology:
 - keywords are reserved terms
 - operators, operands
 - statement (declaration, statement) → a line of code, an instruction that forms an action, made up of expressions
 - expression → anything that "produces a result"
 - scope
 - package-level scope
- Key lesson:
 - := used to create new variables, within code blocks
 - = to assign values ​​to existing variables
